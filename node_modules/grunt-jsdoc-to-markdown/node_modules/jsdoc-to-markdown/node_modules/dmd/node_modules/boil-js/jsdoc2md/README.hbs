#boil-js
Essentially, boil-js is Handlebars plus some extra toys. If a ninja was primarily concerned with generating content he would install this tool. And not tell you.

Yeah it's about populating templates with data but this tool includes extras like helpers, a means for persisting common generation recipes, a streaming interface etc.. You can use it do generate anything from a crafted HTTP POST to a blog.  I'll document properly soon.

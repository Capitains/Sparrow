# About
This software has been developed by @PerseusDL team to provide a simple and ready to use Javascript abstraction/implementation of the CTS norm. On the road leading to the CTS abstraction, we thought it might be nice to provide ready-to-use plugins for various uses and various libraries.

To build the compressed files, in a terminal, in the root of this repository:

```shell
npm install
grunt build
```
